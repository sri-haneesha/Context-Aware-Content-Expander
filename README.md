# Context-Aware-Content-Expander
Context-Aware Content Expander using LLMs
📌 Overview

This project explores automatic text expansion using fine-tuned language models. The system takes a short, concise input (e.g., a headline, abstract, or note) and expands it into a more detailed, context-aware version. Two specialized models were developed:

Factual Expander → generates informative, objective expansions (trained on Wikipedia + CNN data).

Creative Expander → produces imaginative, story-like outputs (trained on TinyStories + Reddit-style data).

🚀 Features

Fine-tuned FLAN-T5 / DistilGPT2 with LoRA adapters for lightweight training.

Interactive demo for real-time content expansion.

Support for both factual and creative text generation.

Training & evaluation implemented with Hugging Face Transformers.

📂 Dataset

Factual Dataset: Wikipedia + CNN articles.

Creative Dataset: TinyStories + Reddit-like text.

Collected concise → detailed text pairs for supervised fine-tuning.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

Hugging Face Transformers

LoRA-based fine-tuning

PyTorch

Jupyter Notebooks for experimentation

📊 Results

The factual model produces concise, knowledge-grounded expansions suitable for academic/educational text.

The creative model generates richer, story-like narratives.

Both models outperform base pretrained models in coherence and relevance (qualitative evaluation).

Example:
Input: "AI is transforming healthcare."

Factual Expansion: "AI is transforming healthcare by improving diagnostic accuracy, enabling predictive analytics, and supporting personalized treatment strategies."

Creative Expansion: "AI is transforming healthcare, with machines acting as silent assistants to doctors, uncovering hidden patterns in patient histories like detectives of the digital age."

🔮 Future Work

Quantitative evaluation using BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore.

Multi-lingual expansion support.

Integration with web app/Chrome extension for real-world usage.
